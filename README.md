This page is dedicated to preparing food.  The home page has recipe blog posts.  The cooking page has a random meal generator.  The baking page has a calculator for bakers math to determine amount of ingredients for bread.  The pickling page has a calculator for the quantity of ingredients to make pickling brine.

If I were to further develop this site, I would link actual recipes to the blog posts as well as include pictures.  I would add more options on the random meal generator on the cooking page with links to recipes for each item.  I would add different bread recipes to the baking page.  I would add some picking suggestions (what kind of veggies) to the pickling page.  I would also link an Amazon affiliate account to suggest tools for people to purchase on Amazon for each specific subject.
